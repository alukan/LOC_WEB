We want player be able to move only his pieces (his color).
In backend for that we need:
- Save colors that are not taken in room (just array of colors)
- Have object where we save pairs. User: color
- When user joins, take 1 color from array and put it to the object.
- When user joins send him his color.
- When user leaves delete him from object and return his color to the array of colors
