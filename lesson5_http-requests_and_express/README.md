# Homework:
1. Create a server with express that will send name from array 'names' (it is in homework/server.js) by request /name:id. User part is already created in homework/user.js.
2. Add to the same server request that will open page index1.html or index2.html or index3.html (/index:id) from browser (just paste path http://localhost:3000/index1 in browser)
Second part is really difficult
