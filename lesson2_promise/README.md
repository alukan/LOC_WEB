# Homework

You can read about Promise.all here (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/all).

In homework.js you have 3 functions, using Promise.all console.log thier results (things that they resolve) at the same time

Without promise.all you can also try to create chain of promises using "then" and "catch" with 2 ".catches". Use "throw error" to create new error inside ".then" block.
It should be like this (.catch -> then -> catch)
