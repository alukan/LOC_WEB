Homework: In the example_with_html/ folder you can see the index.html code that loads and calls the test_callback script. Both index.html and test_script.js contain alerts with numbers in the order in which they are called. Try to understand why they are in this order (this is a very complex code, so feel free to ask me in the chat or in the next lesson, change anything if you need to check how this code works)
For a better understanding, you can try to build a diagram, as I did in the lesson.
