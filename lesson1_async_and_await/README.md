# Homework

In the example_with_html/ folder you can see the index.html code that loads and calls the test_callback script. Both index.html and test_script.js contain alerts with numbers in the order in which they are called. Try to understand why they are in this order (this is a very complex code, so feel free to ask me in the chat or in the next lesson, change anything if you need to check how this code works)
For better understanding you can try to make a diagram (it may not be 100% the same as mine because everyone sees it differently, the diagram just shows how you see it), use any tool you want.
